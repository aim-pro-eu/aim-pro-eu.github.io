Welcome to the second edition of the **AIM-PRO** newsletter!

We are now four months into the project, and the consortium is buzzing with activity. After a successful kick-off in L'Aquila, our focus has shifted to the core foundational work that will structure our AI Literacy framework.

## 🚀 Progress on WP2: The Foundational Framework

Under the leadership of **Mälardalen University (MDU)**, we have started the requirements elicitation phase. The goal is ambitious: defining a common language for AI skills that bridges the gap between Higher Education (HE) and Vocational Training (VET).

We are currently analyzing:
1.  **Green Computing Skills:** How to teach the environmental impact of AI models?
2.  **Deep Tech Skills:** Simplifying Model-Driven Engineering concepts for non-experts.
3.  **Resilience:** Preparing learners for an ever-changing job market.

## 🌿 Spotlight: Green AI

One of AIM-PRO's unique selling points is its focus on sustainability. We are not just teaching how to *use* AI, but how to use it *responsibly*.

> "It is not enough to be digitally literate; we must be ecologically conscious digital citizens."

In the coming weeks, **University of Rennes** will lead a task force to define specific "Green AI" learning outcomes that will be integrated into our OER repository.

## 📅 Upcoming Events

The consortium is preparing for its second Transnational Project Meeting (PM2), which will be held in **Rennes, France** (Month 7).

**Agenda highlights:**
*   Validation of the initial Competence Framework.
*   Workshops on Generative AI tools for educators.
*   First demo of the OER Database architecture by USAL.

## 📢 Get Involved

Are you an educator or a VET trainer? We are looking for early adopters to review our initial findings. Reply to this email or contact us via our website to join the **AIM-PRO Stakeholder Community**.
