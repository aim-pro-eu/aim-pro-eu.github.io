---
In the era of digital transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping societies and economies, presenting both opportunities and challenges for education and professional training. As AI literacy becomes a fundamental competency across sectors, it is crucial to empower individuals—whether in higher education, vocational training, or the workforce—with the knowledge and skills to critically engage with AI technologies. 

**AIM-PRO (AI Literacy for Multidisciplinary Professional Readiness and Outreach)** seeks to bridge this gap by developing innovative, multidisciplinary educational frameworks that integrate AI literacy with Open Education, Generative AI, Model-Driven Engineering and Digital Twin technologies.

AIM-PRO equips educators, learners, and professionals with digital, green, and resilience skills, promoting the responsible use of AI. By focusing on AI literacy, sustainable innovation, and the intersection of AI with entrepreneurial competencies, the project aims to co-develop AI literacy resources tailored to the needs of higher education institutions, VET providers, and SMEs.
